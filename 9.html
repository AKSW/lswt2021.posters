<h1>Korrealation zwischen Sonnenstunden und Immobilienpreisen</h1>
<p><em>Mathis Greve</em></p>

<p>Is there a connection between the average hours of sunshine per year and the price of real estate? Where is the region in Germany that has the most sunshine hours and at the same time the best ratio between income and real estate prices? In this project, sunshine hours per year (averaged over the last 20 years) are compared with median real estate prices at the county level. To ensure that property prices do not only reflect metropolitan areas, a ratio of median income to property prices is formed. This ratio reflects the share of income that is used for housing costs.</p>
